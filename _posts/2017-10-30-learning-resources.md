When learning something new these days one is presented with an overwhelming amount of learning sources to choose from: books,
courses, articles, documentation, stackoverflow, etc. Finding relevant source for learning may be as hard as learning itself. 

While learning some Python and discovering Data Science, I've tried a few resources with various level of success and satisfaction. 
In this post I'd like to compile a list of learning resources that I found helpful for a beginner, and a little past beginner level. 

## Coursera: Python for Everybody Specialization 

Link: [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
 
This is a great course for absolute beginners taught by Charles Severance, Associate Professor, University of Michigan. No previous knowledge i required. 
It has a good flow, it's easy to follow and as in many courses on coursera there are practical exercises and quizzes.
Unfortunately there's no follow up to learn Python at a more advanced level.

## Python Courses on Pluralsight

If you wish to deepen your Python knowledge, I can recommend to look for courses on Pluralsight. For example: 
* ["Python Fundamentals"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-fundamentals/table-of-contents) and ["Python â€“ Beyond the Basics"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-beyond-basics/table-of-contents) by Austin Bingham and Robert Smallshire

These courses are well taught and well structured. The only thing I found missing when compared to courses on coursera were practical exercises and auto-grading. 
I find that this actually helps the learning process and keeps one motivated.

## Data Science Courses on Coursera

Data Science is a vast topic, and there are multiple specializations on Coursera related to Data Science. 
The same University of Michigan offers a [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python). 
If you just want to learn how to use existing data science libraries in Python without understanding how things work and why they do what they do, this might be a course for you.

For me this wasn't enough. I feel strange not understanding what's happening, even when things seem to be working. 
That's why I've enrolled in [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from Stanford University and can genuinely recommend it.
There's a lot of math in it, and no Python (the course uses Octave and Matlab), but you learn what the ML algorithms actually do.
 
## Other resources

### [DataCamp.com](http://datacamp.com/)
DataCamp has a number of data science related courses. I found them a little too simple, not challenging enough, so if you're looking for something easy to begin your data science journey - these courses might be for you.
Plus, they come with interactive practice examples built-in straight in the course time line.    

### [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
A nice source of datasets to play with, plus one can enter a competition. I personally haven't participated yet, but I'm very much looking forward to it. 
Also, you can find some interesting tutorials there. For example, ["Titanic Data Science Solutions"](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) - a tutorial by Manav Sehgal, describing in detail an approach to solving a problem of predicting surviving of passangers based on available training set. 

### Pandas Cookbook by Julia Evans
Great set of pandas tutorials by Julis Evans, I'd say it's a must-read: [Julia Evans's Pandas Cookbook](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/22/cooking-with-pandas/).

### Stackoverflow
And, of course, whenever you have a very specific questions - StakOverflow is the number one place to go to look for answers.
