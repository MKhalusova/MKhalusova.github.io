    <p>Hi! I'm Maria Khalusova. I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, but now I live in Munich, Germany.
        I’m a mother of two little boys and I try to maintain a sustainable living.
        For the last 11 years I’ve been working at JetBrains and participated in IntelliJ IDEA, TeamCity, AppCode and Upsource projects.
        I’ve spoken a number of industry events like JavaZone, Devoxx, JavaDay Kiev, CFCamp, etc.
        Recently I've became fascinated with Data Science, so I’m self-educating myself in this area. In the meantime I’m also dabbling in Python. </p>
