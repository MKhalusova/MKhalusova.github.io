    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="/images/1065417.jpeg" width="130" align="left" hspace="20">
    <p>Hi! I'm Maria Khalusova. I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, then moved to Munich, Germany
        and after living there for about 7 years I've recently relocated again, this time to Montreal, Canada.
        I've been working at JetBrains since 2006 and participated in IntelliJ IDEA, TeamCity, AppCode and Upsource projects.
        I've spoken at a number of industry events like JavaZone, Devoxx, JavaDay Kiev, AnacondaCON, etc.
        Currently I'm a Developer Advocate at JetBrains.
        <br/>
        My passion though, ever since I was a child, was math. I kid you not! That's why I got my degree in Applied Informatics
        in 2007 from the Dept. of Mathematics and Mechanics of Saint Petersburg State University.
        That is probably why I fell in love with Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
        I've spent past years educating myself in these areas and I can't stop learning! I started this blog to share
        what I've learned with whoever finds it helpful, and to keep a handy reference for myself.
