Hi! I'm Maria Khalusova and in this blog I write about data science topics, and general tech. 

I'm a Product Manager/Developer Advocate at JetBrains where I have been working since 2006 and participated in a ton of projects 
including IntelliJ IDEA, TeamCity, PyCharm and Kotlin projects. My recent focus has been on Data Science/Data Engineering tooling and languages.

I'm constantly learning new things around working with data, and I love sharing my knowledge with the community. That's why 
over the years I have presented at a bunch of industry events like JavaZone, PyData, PyCon Canada, AnacondaCON, DataconLA, 
Devoxx, ConFoo, and many more.

I'm also co-organizing [PyData Montreal](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-MTL/) - a community for like-minded data folks to learn, 
share and network.
