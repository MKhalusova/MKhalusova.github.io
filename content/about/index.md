Hi! I'm Maria Khalusova and in this blog I write about data science topics, and general tech. 

I'm a Senior Developer Advocate at Iterative.ai where I work on bringing the best practices from traditional software development such as version control and CI/CD to ML world. Previously I have worked at JetBrains where I participated in many projects including IntelliJ IDEA, TeamCity, PyCharm and Kotlin. 

I'm constantly learning new things around working with data, and I love sharing my knowledge with the community. That's why 
over the years I have presented at a bunch of industry events like JavaZone, PyData, PyCon Canada, AnacondaCON, DataconLA, 
Devoxx, ConFoo, and many more.

I'm also co-organizing [PyData Montreal](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-MTL/) - a community for like-minded data folks to learn, 
share and network.
