    <h1>Talks</h1>
    <h2>Machine Learning Model Evaluation Metrics</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: AnacondaCON 2019, Austin, TX</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Choosing the right evaluation metric for your machine learning project is crucial,
        as it decides which model you’ll ultimately use. Those coming to ML from software development are often
        self-taught, but practice exercises and competitions generally dictate the evaluation metric. In a real-world
        scenario, how do you choose an appropriate metric? This talk will explore the important evaluation metrics used
        in regression and classification tasks, their pros and cons, and how to make a smart decision.</p>

    <h2>Visual Version Control with JetBrains IDEs</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: CodeMash 2019, Sandusky, OH</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Co-presented with Paul Everitt.</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Using version control systems (VCS) like git from the command-line is powerful, but
        arcane and error-prone. Moreso for more-advanced features. JetBrains IDEs put a visual face on version control,
        making you more productive and tying version control into the rest of your programming workflow. In this
        session, we show “Visual VCS” by simulating a real-world collaboration between two developers on a project.
        We’ll cover cloning repositories, branching, committing changes, merging, creating pull requests, and other
        aspects of the GitHub Flow model. We’ll finish with an overview of more-powerful VCS features in the IDE.</p>

    <h2>Code Review Matters and Manners</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: JavaZone 2016, Norway</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Co-presented with Trisha Gee.</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: A code review is basically a technical discussion which should lead to improvements
        in the code and/or sharing knowledge in a team. As with any conversation, it should have substance and form.

        What's involved in a good code review? What kind of problems do we want to spot and address? Trisha Gee will
        talk about things a reviewer may consider when looking at changes: what potential issues to look for; why
        certain patterns may be harmful; and, of course, what NOT to look at.

        But when it comes to commenting on someone's work, it may be hard to find the right words to convey a useful
        message without offending the authors - after all, this is something that they worked hard on. Maria Khalusova
        will share some observations, thoughts and practical tricks on how to give and receive feedback without turning
        a code review into a battlefield.</p>

    <h2>How to stop wasting your time and start performing useful code reviews</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: Devoxx France 2016</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Many teams are adopting code review now, and then find themselves struggling to
        make it work. Do you feel that it takes too much time? Do you think the issues that reviewers find are not
        really deal-breakers? Are you afraid that instead of improved collaboration you are creating a battlefield over
        the code base? There are a number of things that you can do to make code reviews go smoothly and bring
        meaningful, useful results. We'll talk about how we can make code reviews transparent and efficient. We'll
        outline what things we should be looking for when reviewing someone else's code, and how not to lose focus
        hunting extra spaces. And more importantly, we'll talk about the human factor, and how while it's not always
        possible to separate a code from its authors, there are ways to communicate messages effectively.</p>

    <h2>How to get the most out of code reviews</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: JavaDay Kiev 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: As developers we always look for ways to do things faster, better, and automate as
        much as possible. We write code in top-notch IDEs that have static code analysis, automatic refactoring and so
        on, we run unit tests, we use CI servers, and issue trackers, we adopt agile practices to get feedback and
        deliver as fast as possible. As far as code review practice goes, there's still a lot to be improved, and in
        this talk I'm going to tell you how you can perform efficient, transparent and useful code reviews.</p>
