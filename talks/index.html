    <h2>Code Review Matters and Manners</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: JavaZone 2016, Norway</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: This talk had two presenters: me and Trisha Gee.</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: A code review is basically a technical discussion which should lead to improvements in the code and/or sharing knowledge in a team. As with any conversation, it should have substance and form.

        What’s involved in a good code review? What kind of problems do we want to spot and address? Trisha Gee will talk about things a reviewer may consider when looking at changes:  what potential issues to look for; why certain patterns may be harmful; and, of course, what NOT to look at.

        But when it comes to commenting on someone’s work, it may be hard to find the right words to convey a useful message without offending the authors - after all, this is something that they worked hard on. Maria Khalusova will share some observations, thoughts and practical tricks on how to give and receive feedback without turning a code review into a battlefield.</p>

    <h2>How to stop wasting your time and start performing useful code reviews</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: Devoxx France 2016</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Many teams are adopting code review now, and then find themselves struggling to make it work. Do you feel that it takes too much time? Do you think the issues that reviewers find are not really deal-breakers? Are you afraid that instead of improved collaboration you are creating a battlefield over the code base? There are a number of things that you can do to make code reviews go smoothly and bring meaningful, useful results. We’ll talk about how we can make code reviews transparent and efficient. We’ll outline what things we should be looking for when reviewing someone else's code, and how not to lose focus hunting extra spaces. And more importantly, we’ll talk about the human factor, and how while it’s not always possible to separate a code from its authors, there are ways to communicate messages effectively.</p>

    <h2>How to get the most out of code reviews</h2>
    <p><strong>Where</strong>: JavaDay Kiev 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: As developers we always look for ways to do things faster, better, and automate as much as possible. We write code in top-notch IDEs that have static code analysis, automatic refactoring and so on, we run unit tests, we use CI servers, and issue trackers, we adopt agile practices to get feedback and deliver as fast as possible. As far as code review practice goes, there’s still a lot to be improved, and in this talk I’m going to tell you how you can perform efficient, transparent and useful code reviews.</p>
